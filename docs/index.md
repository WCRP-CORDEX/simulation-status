# CORDEX simulations status

These are different views of the CORDEX-CMIP6 simulations status:

 * [Full list of simulations](CMIP6_downscaling_plans.html)
 * [Summary by domain](CORDEX_CMIP6_status.html)
 * [Summary by scenario](CORDEX_CMIP6_status_by_scenario.html)
 * [Summary by experiment](CORDEX_CMIP6_status_by_experiment.html)

## Data Access

 * [CORDEX-CMIP6 Data Servers](CORDEX_CMIP6_data_servers.html) - List of servers hosting CORDEX-CMIP6 data (including non-ESGF servers)



They are generated from [CMIP6_downscaling_plans.csv](https://github.com/WCRP-CORDEX/simulation-status/blob/main/CMIP6_downscaling_plans.csv), which collects the plans from the different groups as gathered in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jy53yvB9SDOiWcwKRJc_HpWVgmjxZhy-qVviHl6ymDM/edit?usp=sharing).
Note that this includes a preliminary collection of various continental-scale empirical-statistical downscaling (ESD) activities that may contribute to CORDEX-CMIP6 ESD.

Check out also the CORDEX-CMIP5 simulations available on ESGF, either as [GCM-RCM matrices by scenario](CORDEX_CMIP5_status_by_scenario.html) or an [interactive list](CORDEX_CMIP5_list.html).
