# CORDEX simulations status

These are different views of the CORDEX-CMIP6 simulations status:

 * [Full list of simulations](CMIP6_downscaling_plans.html)
 * [Summary by domain](CORDEX_CMIP6_status.html)
 * [Summary by scenario](CORDEX_CMIP6_status_by_scenario.html)
 * [Summary by experiment](CORDEX_CMIP6_status_by_experiment.html)

They are generated from the CSV file [CMIP6_downscaling_plans.csv](https://github.com/WCRP-CORDEX/simulation-status/blob/main/CMIP6_downscaling_plans.csv), which collects the plans and status reported from the different groups.
Note that this includes a preliminary collection of various continental-scale empirical-statistical downscaling (ESD) activities that may contribute to CORDEX-CMIP6 ESD.
CORDEX-CMIP6 data are not yet available on ESGF, but a preliminary collection of public servers offering some of these data is available [here](CORDEX_CMIP6_data_servers.html). A list of the planned ESGF data nodes where CORDEX-CMIP6 data will be publised is [here](CORDEX_CMIP6_esgf_nodes.html)

Check out also the CORDEX-CMIP5 simulations available on ESGF, either as [GCM-RCM matrices by scenario](CORDEX_CMIP5_status_by_scenario.html) or an [interactive list](CORDEX_CMIP5_list.html).
