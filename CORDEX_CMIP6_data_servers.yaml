# CORDEX-CMIP6 Data Servers
# This file collects information about servers hosting CORDEX-CMIP6 data
#
# It has two sections :
#    - "non-esgf" : A list of "custom" servers hosting data outside of the ESGF ecosystem.
#    - "esgf" :  A list of ESGF data nodes hosting CORDEX-CMIP6 data with information about the status of publication.
#
# To add a new non-esgf server, create an entry with the following fields:
#   - domain: CORDEX domain_id (e.g., AFR-12, etc.)
#   - institution: Institution hosting the data (free text)
#   - url: URL to access the data
#   - availability: Description of data availability (e.g., "THREDDS", "Download", "OPeNDAP")
#   - comment: Additional information about the server or data
#
# To add information about hosting on the ESGF, create an entry with the following fields:
#  - name : Data node name (for example the hosting institution)
#  - url : URL to the data node, if available.
#  - index : The name of the ESGF index this node is (will be) publishing to : "west" (LLNI) or "east" (CEDA).
#  - status : "planned" or "published" (the server is up), status of the node.
#  - volume : The estimated volume in TiB of data the node will hold.
#  - comment : Free text to better describe the node.
#  - accepting_requests : True if this node is accepting request from groups to host their data.
#  - simulations : A list of search terms that describe which simulations are going to be hosted on this node.
#              Each element of the list if a mapping from columns of `CMIP6_downscaling_plans.csv` to a list of values.
#              Allowed columns are : domain_id, institution_id, source_id, driving_source_id, driving_variant_label, driving_experiment_id
